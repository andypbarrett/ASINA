# ASINA
Code to plot data for NSIDC ASINA page

The plotting routines here are a work in progress.

Currently, code takes 925 hPa air temperature from a netcdf file downloaded from NOAA PSL Month/Seasonal Composites Plotting page and generates a plot
in the NSIDC North Polar Stereographic projection.
